# object-tracking-with-openCV
track multiply objects ( cars ) by using KCF Tracker 


- read the video file that contain cars on the road 
- coding the algorithm and the tracking, detecting objects as we mentioning below:
- import tracking objects inside ( legacy ) from opencv
- define responsible keyboard keys to track or stop tracking then we use (kcf) tracker which performs better on tracking objects.
- adding boxes outside the selected object then update the frame if the selector changed
